## Immutables.org Gson Adapters Provider
Annotation Processor to aggregate all generated `Gson`'s `TypeAdapterFactory`(s) by [Immutables.org](http://immutables.github.io/json.html)

## What is it for?
[Immutables.org](http://immutables.github.io/) is handy for models and [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) type adapters generation,
the problems is you have to register all auto-generated adapters manually
â€“ that's where the processor comes in: it creates simple class to provide `Collection` of `TypeAdapterFacotory`.

## Usage & Installation
```java
GsonBuilder gsonBuilder = new GsonBuilder();
for (TypeAdapterFactory immutablesFactory : new ImmutablesGsonAdaptersProvider().getAdapters()) {
  gsonBuilder.registerTypeAdapterFactory(immutablesFactory);
}
Gson gson = gsonBuilder.create();
```

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

compileJava { // optionally
    options.compilerArgs += '-Aorg.immutables.gson.adapter.package=org.immutables.gson.adapter.util'
    options.compilerArgs += '-Aorg.immutables.gson.adapter.provider_name=ImmutablesGsonAdaptersProvider'
}

dependencies {
    apt 'com.github.techery:immutables-gson-adapters-provider:$version'
}
```

## Caveats
Processor uses only 1 round of annotation processing and while you don't generate interfaces for immutables (to generate models upon) it should be okey.
The most solid solution would involve some gradle plugin to operate with classes generated by every possible round of processing, but is another story.

Also, Immutables.org generates `META-INF/services` file so possibly could be used by `ServiceLoader` but it's not a reliable solution for `android` and could cause performance penalty.
